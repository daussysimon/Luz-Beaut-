aboutUs:
  text:
    Five years ago we had a dream; today, this dream is a reality.  We came to
    visit Naramata and immediately fell in love with the community, the outdoor
    opportunities and the land.  When we purchased our property we felt it must
    have a name. I thought of all sorts of witty and inventive names but my
    husband came up with Playlist.  I asked why, why “Playlist”? He immediately
    said, “Because there is always a playlist in your head.” It is true. I am
    always singing because I know that each day is precious and to be cherished.
    I am the sole creator of each of the product, made from the lavender we
    grow.  I hope you will come visit and create your own “playlist” .
